# Portfolyo Project 
In this project, I customized my personal CV site according to my needs and gave it a dynamic structure. 
The site, which initially had a static structure, was made dynamic in order to improve user experience and facilitate updates.

# Here are some structures and technologies used in the project
- Entity Framework Db First
- MSSQL
- HTML-CSS-BOOSTRAP
- PAGİNG
- DropdownList
- LINQ
- Partial View
